To calculate the average score, you need to sum all the scores and then divide by the number of entries.

Here are the scores from the dataset:

- Alice: 85
- Bob: 92
- Charlie: 78
- Diana: 88
- Eve: 95

Now, let's sum the scores:

85 + 92 + 78 + 88 + 95 = 438

Next, divide the total score by the number of entries (which is 5):

Average Score = Total Score / Number of Entries
Average Score = 438 / 5 = 87.6

So, the average score is **87.6**.
